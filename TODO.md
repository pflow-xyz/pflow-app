WIP
---
- [ ] gno.land version needs multi-token support
- [ ] url-visualizer on gno.land to build out multi-step actions
- [ ] fix token colors - changing colors in the editor should change the diagram
- [ ] fix capacity set to 0 does not remove capacity limitation
- [ ] test that permalink gets updated on edit
- [ ] minURL - add support for multi-token colors

 
  DONE
----
- [x] fix editor interactions - issue selecting text and last few lines of code
- [x] in this project use ./static/form.html and ./static/model.svg as template
- [x] Review roadmap.md - consider deploying gnoland-only version first

BACKLOG
-------
- [ ] fix failing tests
- [ ] complete upgrades for colored tokens
- [ ] check backward-compatible support for URL formats
- [ ] consider adopting https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/tree/main for multi-language support
- [ ] review the plan to implement custom lexer/parser for go, julia, solidity, python
```
/?foo=1&bar=1&baz=1
````
- [ ] build parser/lexer to interpret actions from URL
      where foo, bar, baz are actions and 1 is number of firings
 
- [ ] consider how to deploy indexing on AtomOne w/ https://github.com/allinbits/temporalib

- [ ] test svg image generation on dark mode
- [ ] setup svg badges - does it need? Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *

 
ICEBOX
------
- [ ] Use SVG for UI elements and Canvas for complex rendering
- [ ] backport to pflow.xyz - consider how to store legacy petri-net data to make it compatible with minURL
- [ ] add new sqlite storage for server
- 
- [ ] NEW-STACK: Build viewer -> HTML -> Object -> SVG -> metadata -> CDATA (interactive svg)
- [ ] render w/ SVG only (static)

- [ ] exploring dom updates:update object.data
- [ ] vs live updates inside an embedded SVG using  postMessage().
